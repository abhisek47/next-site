                    A trademark  is a type of intellectual property consisting
                    of a recognizable sign, design,or expression which
                    identifies products or services of a particular source from
                    those of others, although trademarks used to identify
                    services are usually called service marks. The trademark
                    owner can be an individual, business organization, or
                    any legal entity. A trademark may be located on a package,
                    a label, a voucher, or on the product itself. For the sake
                    of corporate identity, trademarks are often displayed on
                    company buildings. It is legally recognized as a type
                    of intellectual property.
