                    GST Number (GSTIN) is a unique 15 digit number which is
                    allotted to the assessed at the time of filing an
                    application for registration for Goods &amp; Service Tax.
                  </Paragraph>
                  <Paragraph strong>
                    As per the GST law, every person (including company, LLP
                    etc) has to register under GST if the total turnover crosses
                    Rs.40 lakh (Rs.20 lakh in case of north eastern states).
                    Hence, if your turnover is more than 40 lakh or is going to
                    be more than 20 lakh, then it is advised that you should go
                    for GST registration.
