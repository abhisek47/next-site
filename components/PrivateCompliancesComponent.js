                  <Paragraph strong>
                    A Private Company is an entity enjoying a separate identity
                    which requires maintaining its active status through the
                    regular filing with MCA. For every company, it is compulsory
                    to file an annual return and audited financial statements
                    with MCA for every financial year. The RoC filing is
                    mandatory irrespective of the turnover, whether it is zero
                    or in crore. Whether a single transaction is undertaken or
                    none, annual compliances for private limited are mandatory
                    for every registered company.
                  </Paragraph>
                  <Paragraph strong>
                    Both the forms are filed to report the activities and
                    financial date for concerned Financial Year. The due dates
                    for annual filing of a company are based on the date of the
                    Annual General Meeting. The continuous failure may lead to
                    the removal of the company’s name from RoC’s register,
                    including disqualification of directors. Also, it has been
                    observed that MCA has actively taken bold steps for dealing
                    with any such failures.
