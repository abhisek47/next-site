                  <Paragraph strong>
                    ESI stands for Employee State Insurance managed by the
                    Employee State Insurance Corporation which is an autonomous
                    body created by the law under the Ministry of Labour and
                    Employment, Government of India. This scheme is started for
                    Indian workers.  Under this scheme, the workers are provided
                    with a huge variety of medical, monetary and other benefits
                    by the employer. Any Company having more than 10 employees
                    (in some states it is 20 employees) who have the maximum
                    salary of Rs. 15000/- has to mandatorily register itself
                    with the ESIC.
                  </Paragraph>
                  <Paragraph strong>
                    Under this scheme, the employer needs to contribute an
                    amount of 4.75% of the total monthly salary payable to the
                    employee whereas the employer needs to contribute only 1.75%
                    of his monthly salary every month of the year. The only
                    exemption to the employee in paying his contribution is
                    whose salary is less than Rs. 100/- per day.
