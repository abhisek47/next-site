The partners become joint business owners and carry out operations governed by the partnership deed. The regulations are minimal, which makes it a desirable option for businesses having joint owners. Moreover, in a partnership firm the partners are jointly and individually liable for debts of the firm. This form of structure is ideal if there are no/ less requirement of external funds and low risk of bad-debts. An apt example of Partnership Firm is a Consultancy firm.',

                    A Partnership Firm is formed as a result of an association
                    of two or more persons to carry on a business in the
                    capacity of co-owners. Partnership Firms in India are
                    governed by the Indian Partnership Act 1932. Section 4 of
                    the Indian Partnership Act of 1932[1] defines partnership as
                    “the relation between person who has agreed to share profits
                    of a business carried on by all or any of them acting for
                    all.” All the partners of the firm share the profits and
                    losses in proportion of their respective owners, or as
                    agreed between them. The limitations of sole proprietorship
                    firm gave rise to Partnership firms. Further, in this blog,
                    you shall learn about the compliances involved in
                    Partnership Firms.
