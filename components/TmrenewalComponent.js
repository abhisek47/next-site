                  <Paragraph strong>
                    The registration of a trademark is valid only for a period
                    of 10 years. After which, it can be renewed from time to
                    time. Trademark renewal preserves those rights which are
                    only available to a registered mark. In case the proprietor
                    fails to renew the trademark, then he shall lose all the
                    protection that comes along with registration. For example,
                    a registered trademark has the benefit of the legal
                    presumption of ownership. That means that the burden of
                    proof is on others to try and disprove your ownership.
