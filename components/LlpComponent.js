                    This is business form which provides benefits of limited
                    liability and flexibility of a partnership business.
                    Compliance requirement is less in LLP as compared to company
                    form of business structure. Audit is exempted up to certain
                    level of turnover in case of LLP. Minimum two people can
                    form an LLP. There is no maximum limit on the number of its
                    partners. This is preferred choice for small businesses and
                    instead of general partnership.We are leading LLP
                    Registration consultants.
